#BoatFight

A game based on the classic board game Battleship, made in C#.

The program is based on this prompt from Treehouse, at the end of the C# Basics course:

##Battleship

Recreate a computer console based version of the popular Battleship game. At a minimum, you’ll want to have 
classes for player, ship, and board. You might want to make other classes as well.

Start by making a two player game where each player has only one ship that takes up a single grid 
square on the game board. Players should be able select where they want to place their ships.

The game board is typically a 10x10 grid, but you might want to make the game board smaller to start out. 
You should be able to change the game board size by changing the value of a single constant.

You may also want to provide a single player option where you play against the computer. Use 
System.Random to randomly place the computer’s ships and to guess the location of its opponent’s ships. 
Think about ways you can make the computer a more challenging opponent by making it “smarter”.

You can continue to make the game more complex and interesting by adding more types of ships 
or allowing the ships to move. Come up with more ways to make the game more interesting and challenging 
and then implement them in your game.

Be sure to practice good input validation by checking that players aren’t accidentally placing ships 
outside of the boundaries of the game board or on top of other ships. Also check that players don’t 
accidentally guess locations that they’ve already guessed.

###Implementation status

Intend to break Treehouse prompt down into various GitHub Issues so I can implement them bit by bit.

Right now the game does nearly nothing, and I cannot recommend anyone download it unless they want to
see a struggling beginner's C# code.
